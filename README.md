# Real-World Pokédex Project  

A living map that places Pokémon into real Earth habitats with coordinates, lore-accurate ecosystems, and field notes.  
Instead of existing only in the Pokémon world, this project asks: *“If Pokémon were real, where would they live?”*  

---

## Project Overview  
- Each Pokémon entry includes:  
  - Region (real-world location)  
  - Habitat (ecology and behavior)  
  - Coordinates (lat/long pin on the map)  
  - Field Entry (written like a Pokédex but in a more narrative style)  

- The goal is to create a global Pokédex atlas that feels immersive, fun, and scientifically grounded.

## Examples  

### Gyarados  
**Region:** Huangpu River near The Bund (central Shanghai)  
**Habitat:** Magikarp thrive in rivers, ponds, and harbors. Rapid urbanization and heavy river use could “stress” Magikarp populations, leading to the emergence of Gyarados. Its destructive power mirrors ancient Chinese dragon myths tied to flooding rivers.  
**Coordinates:** `31.2400° N, 121.4900° E`

### Caterpie  
**Region:** Great Smoky Mountains (Tennessee / North Carolina, USA)  
**Habitat:** Caterpie lives in dense Appalachian forests, feeding on leaves and camouflaging among greenery. Its design reflects real swallowtail caterpillars common in this region.  
**Coordinates:** `35.6532° N, 83.5070° W`

### Kakuna  
**Region:** Great Smoky Mountains (Tennessee / North Carolina, USA)  
**Habitat:** Kakuna rests against tree trunks or branches, resembling a golden seed pod. It barely moves while preparing to evolve into Beedrill. In the Smokies, it blends into bark and moss, often going unnoticed.  
**Coordinates:** `35.6850° N, 83.5450° W`

## Tech Stack  
- Frontend: React + Leaflet (interactive map and popups)  
- Icons: Pokémon sprites with custom markers  
- Styling: CSS (clean, minimal, focused on readability)  
- Data: JSON entries containing Region, Habitat, and Coordinates
